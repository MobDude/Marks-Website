            Me and my sister set out on our year tradition of canoeing on our ice covered lake. Its always fun to see just how frozen the lake is this time of year. Usually it is not really all that frozen, except for the bays.

            This year there was abit more ice than usual and we were actually about to be fully above the ice in the canoe. This made it really tricky to get around, and was undoubtedly terrible for our canoe. That being said, its still alot of fun.

            We managed to get a little ways by basically jumping with the boat forwards. Its a little hard to explain, but basically one person put their stomach on the end of the boat with thier legs over the edge and hands on the gunnels. The other person would try to to time a their jump with the firsts push off of the ice. If we timed this well, the boat would be free of weight right as we pushed causing us to make good distance. This method also kept us from risking falling through, as if our foot went through while pushing, we would just fall into the boat. WHile this did work, it was also slow and exhausting. We could see a little bit of open water ahead, but we didnt alctually make it all the way there.
