                        My name is Mark and I am studying Software Engineering at Carleton University. I mostly use Java, C and Python, but also have some experience with Racket, Go, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br><br>

                        I love trying new things. I play alot of video games, though these days its mostly just when I can get together with friends. Me and my friends also spend three nights a week watching movies together. Some are great, most are mediocre, and some are truely horible. <br><br>

                        I also have a passion for music. It is something that I am still learning about myself. I've been learning guitar for about four years now, and sometimes dabble in playing piano. I also love listening to music, and I am always looking for new artists to listen to. <br><br>

                        I love spending time outside. I enjoy going for bike rides around the city, doing backpacking and camping trips and spending time canoeing. I have a particular love for the ocean and sailing. I hope one day to be able to buy my own boat and sail around the world.  <br>
